# OTT Competitor Analysis

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the competitive landscape in the Over-The-Top (OTT) streaming market, focusing on five major platforms: **Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar, Zee5,** and **Jio Cinema**. The analysis includes a SWOT assessment of each service, key metrics for comparison, and data visualizations to highlight their respective strengths and weaknesses.

## Objectives
- To evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each OTT platform.
- To compare key metrics such as subscription pricing, content variety, and user engagement.
- To identify opportunities and threats in the rapidly evolving OTT landscape.

## Contents
1. **SWOT Analysis**: An in-depth examination of each platformâ€™s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
2. **Comparison Table**: A side-by-side comparison of key metrics such as subscription pricing, original content strength, regional focus, and global reach.
3. **Data Analysis**: An analysis of various metrics using Python to derive insights.
4. **Visualizations**: Graphical representations of data, including bar charts and pie charts, to illustrate the competitive landscape effectively.

## Key Findings
- **Netflix**: Known for its vast library of original content and global reach but faces challenges with high pricing and regional content.
- **Amazon Prime Video**: Offers a bundled service with Amazon but suffers from a confusing user interface.
- **Disney+ Hotstar**: Strong in regional content and exclusive Disney titles, but reliant on live sports and limited international offerings.
- **Zee5**: Focuses on regional content with affordable pricing but lacks a diverse international library.
- **Jio Cinema**: Provides free content to Jio users but needs to enhance its original content and quality.

## Requirements
To run the analysis and generate visualizations, you will need:
- **Python 3.x**: The programming language for analysis.
- **Libraries**: Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required Python libraries.

## Data Visualization
The project includes several visualizations to effectively communicate findings:
- **Bar Charts**: Used to compare subscription pricing and content strengths.
- **Pie Chart**: Illustrates the percentage distribution of subscription prices among the platforms.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the analysis to include user satisfaction surveys and churn rates.
- Incorporate more detailed metrics on content engagement and viewership trends.
- Consider geographical expansion strategies for each platform.
